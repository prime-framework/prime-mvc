/**
 * <p>
 * Converters are used to convert objects from one type
 * to another, convert strings to objects and to convert from
 * objects and strings to arrays of objects. The way that
 * this is setup is that a Converter implementation is
 * registered with the ConverterRegistry. The registry can
 * then be queried for a particular Conveter (see {@link
 * ConverterProvider} for more information about retrieval).
 * Next, the Converter can be used for conversions using one
 * of the methods described below. Any given Converter may be
 * used to convert to many different types because of the way
 * that the ConverterRegistry searches for Converters. Because
 * of this flexibility when converting the Converter
 * must be told what type to convert to. This is the reason
 * for the second Class parameter on all of the convert
 * methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The type that appears on all of the methods in this interface can
 * be any type that is support by the Converter, but generally is
 * a type that is the type or a sub-type of the type the converter is
 * registered for. For example, let's say the converter is registered
 * to java.lang.Number, then this converter should be able to convert
 * Integer, Long, Double, etc. unless a converter is registered for
 * each one of these. So, we could call the converter with ("0.5",
 * Double.class) in order to convert the String to a Double object.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Arrays</h3>
 * <p>
 * Arrays pose a significant issue when considering null values and
 * multi-dimensional arrays as well as communicative conversion (i.e.
 * a -> b -> a). Because of this, implementations are free to NOT
 * support multi-dimensional arrays, null values or communicative
 * conversions. When supporting these concepts however implementations
 * must take care to use array delimiters and null indicators. The
 * recommended versions of these are:
 * </p>
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Name</th><th>Recommendation</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>Array open</td><td>{</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>Array close</td><td>}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>Array separator</td><td>,</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>Null indicator</td><td>__#null#__</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>
 * We highly recommend against crazy array handling and just focus
 * on simple String/Object conversions. However, single dimensional
 * arrays should almost always be handled correctly. You only need
 * to support String to array conversions. Array to String conversions
 * are rarely necessary.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Null values</h3>
 * <p>
 * When peforming any conversion of a single value that is null, it
 * is recommended that implementations return null.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Primitives</h3>
 * <p>
 * There are already pre-written conversion for primitives, but when
 * overriding these, implementations must ensure that during conversions
 * of nulls, that the default value of the primitive is returned.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Custom converters</h3>
 * <p>
 * In order to write a custom type converter, you need to implement this
 * interface AND also annotate your converter class with the
 * {@link org.jcatapult.mvc.parameter.convert.annotation.GlobalConverter} annotation
 * and specify in that annotation the types the Converter supports.
 * Next, you need to define the Converter in a Guice module that will
 * be discovered by JCatapult like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void bind() {
 *   bind(MyCustomerConverter.class);
 * }
 * </pre>
