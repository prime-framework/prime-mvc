     * @return  The value of the action annotation is used to determines the URI suffix patterns that
     *          the action class can handle. This is also known as RESTful URI handling. The pattern
     *          is derived from the current WADL specification from Sun. The base URI for the action
     *          is fixed based on the package and class name. However, everything after the base
     *          can be set into properties or fields of the action class using the WADL pattern here.
     *          The pattern is like this:<br/>
     *          <br/>
     *          <pre>
     *          {id}
     *          </pre>
     *          <p>
     *          If the classes base URI is /admin/user/edit, the full specification for the URI that
     *          action can handle would be:
     *          </p>
     *          <pre>
     *          /admin/user/edit/{id}
     *          </pre>
     *          <p>
     *          If the URI is <strong>/admin/user/edit/42</strong>, the value of 42 would be added
     *          to the HTTP request parameters under the key <strong>id</strong>. In most cases this
     *          means that the value will also be set into the action, but it could also be used as
     *          a {@link org.jcatapult.mvc.parameter.annotation.PreParameter}.
     *          </p>
