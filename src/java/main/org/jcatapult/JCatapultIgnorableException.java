/**
 * <p>
 * This class is a runtime exception that the JCatapult framework will throw from
 * various locations that can be safely ignored in a production environment. This
 * was created to prevent DOS attacks on production servers. For example, the
 * JCatapult MVC throws an exception when an incoming parameter doesn't map to
 * the action. This exception is generally only useful in development mode, but
 * sometimes it proves useful in production. For this reason, it is ignorable in
 * most cases.
