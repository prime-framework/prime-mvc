/**
 * This package contains all of the JEE integration points for JCatapult.
 * In most cases, JCatapult web application projects will primarily use
 * only the {@link JCatapultFilter} and the {@link JCatapultServletContextListener}
 * in the web.xml file. The JCatapultFilter transfers control over to the
