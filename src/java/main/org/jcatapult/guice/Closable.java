/**
 * <p>
 * This interface defines a class that is Closable by JCatapult's Guice integration.
 * If you mark a class with this interface, JCatapult will attempt to close the class
 * when the contain is shutdown. It is advised to only mark singletons as Closable.
 * Otherwise, JCatapult will end up creating a new instance and then calling close on
 * it, which could fail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to ensure that a class you have marked as Closable will be closed, you
 * must provide a Guice binding for it. Otherwise, Guice will not know anything about
 * the class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To provide a Guice binding for your Closable, create a Guice module and put it
 * in a package named <strong>guice</strong> in your project. Inside this module
 * provide a binding for your Closable like this:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * bind(MyClosable.class);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This will allow your class to be Closed.
