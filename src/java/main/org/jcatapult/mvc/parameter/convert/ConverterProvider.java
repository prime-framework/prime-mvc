     * the converter associated with the given type of associated with a super
     * class of the given type (not interfaces). This principal also works with
     * arrays. If the type is an array, then what happens is that the array type
     * is asked for its component type using the method getComponentType and this
     * type is used to query the manager. So, the converter registered for Number
     * is returned Double[] is queried (because Double is queried and since no
     * converter was register for it, then Number is checked).
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Normal types work the exact same way. First the type is checked and then
     * its parents are checked until Object is reached, in which case null is
     * returned.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Primitive values are treated as their wrapper classes. So, if int.class
     * is passed into this method (queried) then either a converter registered
     * for Integer, or Number or null is returned depending on what converters
     * have been registered so far.
